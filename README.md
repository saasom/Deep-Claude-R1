# Deep-Claude-R1 ü§ñ‚ö°

**A Fun Experiment Combining DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet**

A playful project that chains together two AI models - using DeepSeek-R1's quick thinking and Claude-3.5-Sonnet's thoughtful analysis to explore how AIs can work together. Built because I was curious about what would happen!

## Pretty Terminal Output

![Terminal Preview](assets/terminal-preview.png)

- üé® **Nice Colors**: Makes the AI responses easy on the eyes
- üìù **Clean Layout**: Neat boxes separate different parts of the conversation
- üîÑ **Loading Spinners**: Watch the AIs think with fancy spinners
- üí° **Highlighted Code**: Code snippets that pop

## Features

- üß† **Two AIs Working Together**: DeepSeek thinks fast, Claude thinks deep
- üîÑ **Chain of Thought**: DeepSeek's first take helps Claude give better answers
- üõ† **Built with**: 
  - TypeScript for the serious bits
  - Python for the pretty terminal stuff
  - Some nice error handling so things don't break
- üìä **Compare Responses**: See how the two AIs think differently
- üîç **See the Process**: Watch the AIs reason step by step

## Fun Things to Try

- Solve puzzles with two AI helpers
- Compare how the AIs think differently
- Test their reasoning abilities
- See how they handle tricky questions
- Learn about AI behavior

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the package.json version if applicable
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/Deep-Claude-R1/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/Deep-Claude-R1/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write Bug Reports With Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
